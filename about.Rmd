### Motivation for Topic Research 

The U.S. H-1B Work Visa is an employment-based visa that grants an extended amount of stay for eligible temporary workers in the U.S. The standard duration of stay is three years, but can be extended up to six years. Laws limit the maximum distribution of new H-1B visas each year, and the selection process involves random computer generation from an eligible application pool, also known as the “H-1B lottery” by some. 
 
As immigration policies are changing in the U.S., many international students are concerned about their eligibility to work in the states. We as international students and friends of international students are interested in learning more about the H-1B visa process and how H-1B visa applications will affect or dictate our job-seeking opportunities after graduate school.</br><br>

### Data and Methods

Data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification. The dataset contained personal details of the employer requesting temporary labor certification as well as H-1B applicants' job titles. For this project, we specifically focused on the data for 2018, with some skimming of the data from 2010-2017 due to the large file sizes and sample sizes for each individual year. We filtered the data to only include certified H-1B cases and employers located within the US.

### Research Questions

- Which states hire the most H-1B workers? 

- For companies that hire H-1B workers, where are they located? 

- What cities in California hire the most H-1B workers? 

- What are the top companies that hire the most H-1B workers?

- What industries hire the most H-1B workers and what is the average wage? </br><br>

### Findings 

From our data, the top 10 US states that hired the most H-1B workers in 2018 were California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Georgia, and Florida. 

The majority of H-1B approved applications were in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math), with the top industries for total number of H-1B visa applications being computer/math, business/finance, and architecture/engineer.
