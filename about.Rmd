### Motivation for Topic Research 

As immigration policies are changing in the U.S., many international students are concerned about their eligibility to work in the states. We as international students and friends of international students are interested in learning more about H-1B sponsorship opportunities and how H-1B visa applications will affect or dictate our job-seeking potential after graduate school.

### Data and Methods

Data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s Office of Foreign Labor Certification. The dataset contained personal details of the employer requesting temporary labor certification as well as H-1B applicants' job titles. For this project, we specifically focused on the data for 2018, with some skimming of the data from 2010-2017 due to the large file sizes and sample sizes for each individual year. We filtered the data to only include certified H-1B cases and employers located within the US.
