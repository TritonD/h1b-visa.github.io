### Motivation
H1B (Work Visa) is an employment based visa that is granted to an eligible temporary worker in the US.The duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years. Laws limit only 85,000 H-1B visas to be issued each year.The selection process is computer randomly generated from the eligible application pool, which is called "H-1B lottery" by some.

As immigration policies are changing in the US. Many international students are concerned about their eligibility to work in the states. As international students and friends of international students who are able to graduate, we are interested in how H1B visa applications will affect/dictate our job-seeking opportunities. </br><br>


### Methods
Data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification. The dataset contain personal details of the employer requesting temporary labor certification and the role itself. For this project, we specifically focused on 2018's data, with some glancing over data from 2010-2017 due to the large sample size for each individual year. We filtered the data to only include H-1B cases that were "certified" and the employer is located in the United States.
