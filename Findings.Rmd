### H-1B Applications by State 

In 2018, the top 5 states that had the most H-1B applications in descending order were California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. A majority of the states with more than 10,000 H-1B cases were located on the East coast. It is interesting to note, however, that there were more companies with headquarters in New Jersey wanting to sponsor H-1B applicants compared to in New York and Texas. 
 
When looking at mean annual wages, California, Washington, and Maine were the top 3 worksite states with the highest mean annual wages. Most states had mean annual wages between $70,000-90,000. However, there was not necessarily a correlation between average annual wage and number of H-1B applications. Washington and Maine were states that did not have a large number of applicants but did have a high average annual wage. 
 
The top states that employ the most H-1B applicants, such as California, Texas, and New York, are attractive to foreign workers for a variety of reasons. These reasons could include having a larger initial population size, being good places to settle down or further one’s professional career, increased networking opportunities, and better access to higher-paying jobs.

### H-1B Applications by Industry and Occupation
There was a total of approximately 570,000 certified H-1B applicants. The difference between the first and second most popular occupational fields was quite large; the most popular fields of math and technology had 397,562 number of H-1B applicants compared to the next popular fields of business and finance, which had 46,055 applicants, which is a significant difference. 
 
However, the occupations with the most H-1B applicants did not correlate with having the highest median wages. The fields with the highest median wages were management ($118,144), sales ($102,232), and healthcare ($84,760). In contrast to the immense number of H-1B applicants in the fields of math and technology, the median wages for these fields were around $84,698, just slightly below the healthcare field. 
 
As we expected, the top companies that hired the most H-1B applicants were consulting and technology companies because they employ workers from a wide range of analytical backgrounds.

### H-1B Applications wage statisics
When looking at mean annual wages, California, Washington, and Maine were the top 3 worksite states with the highest mean annual wages. Amongst the three states, California’s mean annual wage was $102,054, Washington’s mean annual wage was $99,153, and Maine’s mean annual wage was $90,434 in 2018.
