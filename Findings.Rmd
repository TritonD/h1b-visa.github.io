### H-1B Applications by State 

In 2018, the top 5 states that had the most H-1B applications in descending order were California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. A majority of the states with more than 10,000 H-1B cases were located on the East coast. It is interesting to note, however, that there were more companies with headquarters in New Jersey wanting to sponsor H-1B applicants compared to in New York and Texas. 
 
When looking at mean annual wages, California, Washington, and Maine were the top 3 worksite states with the highest mean annual wages. Most states had mean annual wages between $70,000-90,000. However, there was not necessarily a correlation between average annual wage and number of H-1B applications. Washington and Maine were states that did not have a large number of applicants but did have a high average annual wage. 
 
The top states that employ the most H-1B applicants, such as California, Texas, and New York, are attractive to foreign workers for a variety of reasons. These reasons could include having a larger initial population size, being good places to settle down or further one’s professional career, increased networking opportunities, and better access to higher-paying jobs.
